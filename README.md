# DH140 - Winter 2023

Coding & data science project space for DH140, Coding for Humanities.

## Data and viz of interest
[This article](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115) discusses how exposure to opposing viewpoints on social media can actually increase political polarization. This is interesting because we often believe the opposite, that seeing the same viewpoints creates an echo chamber.

I would like to learn how to scrape data from Twitter's API to determine the times and frequencies of tweets. I like this image because it is visually interesting and allows us to easily learn something interesting.

## Ideas for data to investigate
* Gender and women's studies
* Languages

I am most interested in web scraping and APIs because I have little experience in these areas and believe they are very useful skills.
